# Lung-Cancer-Detection
<p>
This project focuses on "Lung Analysis," an advanced image processing script designed to automatically detect and classify lung cancer in medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans. By automating this process, the project aims to improve the accuracy and speed of lung cancer diagnosis, reducing the workload for radiologists and enhancing patient outcomes.
